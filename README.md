# household_power_consumption
A python project that helps you optimize your power consumption based on statistics of your home and variable electricity rates.

Developed by: Sajal Suhane

The model in householdPower.py works on ARIMA forecasting (AutoRegression Integrated Moving Average).

The model in householdPower_Naive.py works on Naive forecasting strategies.

Clone, Download or fork the project and run it on IDLE with some pre requisites which are as follows:

numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
pandas
statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots

The model will automatically split the dataset into training and testing data. 

Various attributes used for prediction are:

Global_active_power
Global_reactive_power
Voltage
Global_intensity
Sub_metering_1
Sub_metering_2
Sub_metering_3


Thanks. Hope you enjoy the project! :)
